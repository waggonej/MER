# MER
Rocket orbits Moon, Moon orbits Earth

Call this function with a python call line of:
python MER.py A B C D

Where

  A is the number of lunar orbits (recommended value of 0.1)
  
  B is the percent (0 - 100) of lunar orbital speed for the rocket (recommended value of 100)
  
  C is the angle of attack (in degrees) for the rockets initial velocity (recommended value of 0)
  
  D is the number of points to be plotted per 1 orbit of the moon (recommended value of 1000. A x D should never exceed 100)
  
Therefore call:

  python MER.py 0.1 100 0 100
